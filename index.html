				<p>I am currently a third year at IIT with a major in ITM. My race/ethnicy is Mexican and guatemalan.
				I am also asian, and my last name came from my great-great grandfather, who migrated from China to
				Guatemala. I like to bike to work from home, and I enjoy playing video games on my free time. I am
				a very competitive person when it comes to games in general, and I like to play a number of sports
				(football, soccer, baseball, and tennis to name a few). I'm usually quiet and softspoken af first,
				but I open up once I get to know you.</p>
